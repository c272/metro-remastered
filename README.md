# Metro for Steam
*metroforsteam.com*

This repository is a mirror of the unofficial updated version of Metro for Steam, "Remaster 3.0", made by TheHopelessGamer over on the Steam discussion thread. [link](https://steamcommunity.com/id/The_HopelessGamer)

The file is currently hosted on MEGA, with no other available mirrors or way to fork/edit the source, so I thought I'd host the forked update version here for people to tweak and edit for future breaking changes.
